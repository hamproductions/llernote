# Architecture

## Overview

LLerNote is a static, offline-first SPA (prerendered by Vike). All event/song/cast data is bundled at build time; all user data lives in `localStorage`. There is no backend.

## Data flow

- **Static data**: JSON in `data/` imported directly into the bundle (`hooks/useData.ts`). Module-level `Map`s give O(1) lookups; everything is immutable.
- **User data**: `utils/attendance/storage.ts` exposes `SyncedStore<T>` — a localStorage-backed store with a subscriber set. React components consume it through `useSyncExternalStore` (`hooks/useAttendance.ts`), so any write re-renders every subscribed component without prop drilling or context.

## Key decisions

- **localStorage over IndexedDB**: attendance records are ~200 bytes each; even 1000 events ≈ 200 KB, far below the 5 MB budget. The `SyncedStore` interface isolates the backend so it can be swapped later.
- **Tombstones, not deletes**: removing a mark sets `deleted: true` + `updatedAt` instead of dropping the key. Required for conflict-free sync later (see SYNC.md).
- **Cast filter is derived**: performances carry no artist IDs, so `performance-cast.ts` walks setlist → song → artist → character once (cached module-level) to answer "which casts appeared at this event".
- **Share images**: `modern-screenshot`'s `domToBlob` on a real DOM node (StatsCard / MyPickCard) at 2× scale — no canvas drawing code to maintain.
- **Setlist song numbering**: non-song items (MC/VTR/custom) get no number; numbering is precomputed per item id before render.

## Conventions

- Park UI primitives in `components/ui` are generated (`bun codegen:components`); never hand-edit.
- Panda CSS style props; dynamic (data-driven) colors go through `style={{}}` (the 4 lint warnings for this are accepted).
- i18n: every user-visible string goes through `t()`; locales at `src/i18n/locales/{en,ja}.json`.
- Dates are `YYYY-MM-DD` strings; compare with `localeCompare`, never `new Date()` parsing (timezone traps).
